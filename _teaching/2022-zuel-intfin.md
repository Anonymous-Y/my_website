# Class Requirements

**I. Homework (30%)**

You will have 2-3 HW assignments throughout this semester.

HW can be done in groups but each of you need to turn in your own HW.

HW deadlines are HARD deadlines. If you do not have a good reason (e.g. medical emergency), I will deduct 10-50 points based on how late your HW is turned in.

**II. Presentation (30%)**

Try to form a study group (2-3 people per group) by the end of this week. Each group will have 90 minutes to present their replication results of a chosen paper in the last 3 weeks. 

Please send me the names of your group members and the paper you choose before **September 6th**. 

**III. Final Report (40%)**

Each group needs to turn in one report to describe the paper replication process in detail. For example, the obstacles you overcome or other issues you find in the original paper. Also, please clearly state in your report each team member's contribution to this project.
