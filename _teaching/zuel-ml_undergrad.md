**Project & Presentation (50%)**

Students are required to form study groups, each consisting of 2 to 3 members, and collaboratively work on a project on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions). At the end of this semester, each group needs to present their findings and project outcomes.

**Final Report (50%)**

Each study group needs to submit a report detailing the application of machine learning models to their Kaggle project. Additionally, please clearly state in your report each team member's contribution to this project. (under 20 pages, Times New Roman, 12pt, 1.5 line space)

**Final Report DUE DATE:** 2025-07-06 23:59
